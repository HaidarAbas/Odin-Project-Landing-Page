# Odin-Project Landing Page
#### By Haidar Abas

## Description

**Tech used: HTML, CSS**

Here you'll find my first landing page created as one of the activites for the Odin Project.

This project demonstrates the use of multiple html elements, styled with css, to produce a
commonly seen landing page. The focus being on the use of multiple flexboxes to arrange a
variety of components to match the desired outcome.
